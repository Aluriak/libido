# Explore Python source code to find dependencies

Use [pip show](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29751732/3077939) if you want to access the explicit dependencies of a python package.

But, if you have a set of python files and want to know what they are importing, libido is a way to go.


## Installation & usage

    pip install libido
    libido mod.py pak/*.py pak2/

See [Makefile](Makefile) for examples, and in doubt, just run libido on any python source file (`libido file.py`).


## Options

There is some options. See `libido --help`.

Most interestings may be
`--python-version` to provide the python version of the code (because stdlib is not the same accross python versions),
`--all-deps` to list all deps, including the one from stdlib (default is only the non-stdlib one),
`--show-globs` to show for each dependencies which input glob needs it,
or `--porcelain` for a parsable output.


## How does it works ?

Libido parses the source code with [redbaron](https://github.com/PyCQA/redbaron) find all import lines,
and compare list of imported modules with historical records provided by [stdlibs](https://stdlibs.omnilib.dev/en/stable/) to decide which imported packages belong to the stdlib.

Yes, these packages exists. That's so cool. Please send your thanks to the author of redbaron and stdlibs.
